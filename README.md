This repository, called "pdd_algorand," consists of three interdependent projects:
1. "pdd_flutter_app," a Flutter-based app that serves as the dapp
2. "pdd_flask_cc_app," a Python Flask-based web app that includes the Command Center web part and REST APIs used by "pdd_flutter_app"
3. "pdd_smartcontract," an Algorand Beaker-based smart contract written in Python that provides the code for the smart contracts used by the above two apps.
